## What?

What's all the buzz about **open science** and **reproducibility**?

**MRI Together** is a global online event on Open Science and Reproducibility in MRI. The meeting hosts lectures, panel discussions, and hands-on workshops by prominent speakers from industry and academia. Topics ranging from statistical tools for reproducible research, to open hardware and software practices, to data sharing policies, and the obstacles and best practices in using artificial intelligence in MRI will be covered.

Topics will include, but not be limited to:

* Open source tools for acquisition, reconstruction and analysis
* Wellbeing and inclusive research practices
* Challenges in open deep-learning research
* Data sharing
* Open Science and Open Development from a vendors' perspective
* The reproducibility crisis
* Open publication


## When?
The workshop will be held on **December 5 to 8, 2022 (UTC)**. We will have [sessions in all time zones](/schedule), and all the talks will be recorded and available for immediate offline use.
