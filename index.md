Meanwhile, we are excited to accounce that MRI Together will be back in **December 2022**, and this is the space to watch for updates!

## What?

What's all the buzz about **open science** and **reproducibility**?

**MRI Together** is a global online event on Open Science and Reproducibility in MRI. The meeting hosts lectures, panel discussions, and hands-on workshops by prominent speakers from industry and academia. Topics ranging from statistical tools for reproducible research, to open hardware and software practices, to data sharing policies, and the obstacles and best practices in using artificial intelligence in MRI will be covered.
