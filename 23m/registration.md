## Registration

Aligned with the workshop's vision of inclusivity the registeration is free. However, we encourage senior funded researchers and PIs to register as donating attendees. 
Donations will go into a pot that also contains the contributions from our [corporate sponsors](/sponsors), and will be used to support projects and initiatives in the open-science and reproducibility sphere after covering the operational costs of the meeting. 
The donors will be acknowledged [here](/sponsors) (from which you can decide to opt out).

By participating in [**#MRITogether**](https://twitter.com/hashtag/MRITogether) in any form you agree to the [**code of conduct**](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT).
