## Registration

Aligned with the workshop's vision of inclusivity the registeration is free. However, we encourage senior funded researchers and PIs to register as donating attendees. 
Donations will go into a pot that also contains the contributions from our [corporate sponsors](/sponsors), and will be used to support projects and initiatives in the open-science and reproducibility sphere after covering the operational costs of the meeting. 
The donors will be acknowledged [here](/sponsors) (from which you can decide to opt out).

By participating in [**#MRITogether**](https://twitter.com/hashtag/MRITogether) in any form you agree to the [code of conduct](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT).

Detailed information about how to attend the workshop will be provided to the registrants closer to the date.

## Call for abstracts

We are inviting abstract submissions prioritizing *open, reproducible, and inclusive MR research*. We also encourage submissions highlighting *best practices for a completely open pipeline* (from data acquisition to publication). 
We aim to provide a space for *innovative open tools and initiatives* to communicate their efforts. Also, if you have *reproduced a MRI study (or have failed to do so)*, this is a great space to showcase that.

Submissions **will not be scored**, but will be evaluated on scientific integrity and relevance to the workshop. Please be sure to highlight how your abstract fits within the workshop mission and detail ethical  considerations. The submitted abstracts will not be visible online.
Upon acceptance, presentation format will be 3-5 min recorded videos. Videos will be also accessible on the GatherTown platform for viewing and discussions. The selected best abstracts will also **get rewarded!**

### Mind Matching
Meet the people most important to you! MRI Together will feature a computer-assisted networking event. 
Participants will meet and engage in conversation with 5-6 other like-minded MRI researchers. [A magical algorithm](https://neuromatch.io) will determine who meets whom and when. If you choose to participate in this event, you will be asked to provide up to 3 abstracts that are representative of your research in the registration form. Don't miss the fun!
