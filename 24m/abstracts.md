# Abstract submission is now OPEN!

We are inviting abstract submissions for the 2024 edition of the **MRITogether Meeting**. This year's theme will be **Staying together: Long-term support and development of open MRI projects**.

This call will prioritize submissions focusing on **open science, reproducibility, and sustainability in MR research**. We also encourage submissions highlighting **best practices for a completely open pipeline** (from data acquisition to publication). We aim to provide a space for innovative open tools and initiatives to communicate their efforts. Also, if you have reproduced an MRI study (or have failed to do so), this is a great space to showcase that.

Submission acceptance will be based on scientific integrity and relevance to the workshop. Please make sure to highlight how your abstract fits within the workshop mission and detail ethical considerations. *The submitted abstracts will not be visible online*.

Upon acceptance, presentation format will be Poster Sessions in GatherTown based on 3-5 min recorded videos. Selected abstracts may be presented as proffered abstracts in our Oral Sessions, so please specify the appropriate session category during submission. Videos will also be made available on YouTube, unless you specify otherwise. The best abstracts will receive poster awards (certificates and cash prizes).

Abstracts can be submitted as PDF files, based on a [docx template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Hr96AJyqSgXuWjllQhSWlEFUV-TkZWuj/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=114252464023784928785&rtpof=true&sd=true) (max. 2 pages, including figures). Consider writing your abstract as a pitch of your work, otherwise the traditional Background, Methods, Results, Discussion format is welcome. Your figure may also be a graphical abstract. 

**Submission Deadline is 27 November 2024** - Submit [HERE](https://forms.gle/LKPN1w6un2EYSgkVA)!
