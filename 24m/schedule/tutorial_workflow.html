	      <a> From DICOM to AI models – a workflow using Python for MR image processing</a>
	      <p> Yu Sun, University of Sydney, AU</p>
          <p> Python is a modern scripting language widely used in scientific computing. This talk will show you a workflow to extract voxel data from DICOM, apply filters, augment data and feed data to a deep learning model. It’s a close look of how Python is used in everyday clinical research. You'll find the beauty of how elegantly Python connects various pieces together. If you're relatively new to Python or want to build an automation pipeline, this talk will set you at a good position to get started. <strong>You will be able to follow along with this tutorial for yourself by executing the code on Colab if you wish.</strong></p>
