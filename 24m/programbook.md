### **Reproducibility crisis revisited** (17:00-19:00 UTC)
#### **Zhi-Yi Chen**: Population diversity flaw in the AI-empowered neuroimaging studies and generalization failure
Though the immense potentials and unprecedented increases in the AI-empowered neuroimaging-based studies, particularly in diagnostics, global population diversity in these computational models are highly underrepresented. Embracing AI techniques in the  neuroimaging studies should be greatly welcomed, but as a result, sampling inequalities from AI model training and testing biases from AI model deployments substantially limited their real-world practices and ensuing benefits.
#### **Stephanie Noble**: Mapping the Landscape of Effect Sizes in fMRI: Insights from Large Publicly Available Dataset
Understanding what range of effect sizes are “typical” for fMRI studies is essential for better study planning and interpretation of results, especially given recent concerns about reproducibility and statistical power in fMRI research. Here, we leverage large, publicly available datasets to benchmark expected effect sizes for “typical” studies and introduce a web app for exploring these effects. We emphasize the need to plan for small effect sizes and discuss paths forward, including our next steps developing an empirical power calculator web app.
#### **Martin Hebart**: The THINGS initiative: Improving the generalizability of research findings in vision and semantics across studies, methods, and domains
Visual and semantic processing has been studied using both hypothesis-driven and data-driven approaches. However, the generalizability of research findings always depends on the selection of stimulus materials, and with inconsistent use of materials, it has been challenging to directly relate research findings across studies, research methods (e.g., behaviour, fMRI, electrophysiology), and domains (e.g., humans, animal models, artificial intelligence). To overcome these challenges, we have introduced the THINGS initiative, which is a global initiative of researchers to collect and share datasets all based on the THINGS database of object concepts and images. In this talk, I will highlight the opportunities afforded by this initiative, introduce available datasets, and highlight research findings that have underscored the value of this approach.

## Day 4 December 6th
### **Collaborative coding towards more impactful solutions** (1:00 - 3:00 UTC)
#### **Chris Rorden**: NiiVue: Modular neuroimaging visualization based on web technologies
Visualization plays a crucial role in neuroimaging acquisition, processing, inference and dissemination. The AFNI, FSL and FreeSurfer have created competing desktop tools, making it hard for users to transfer skills and data between these frameworks. We have harnessed the collective wisdom of these teams to develop NiiVue using web technologies. This allows a zero-footprint tool that works regardless of device (computer, phone, tablet), operating system, hardware or framework. In addition to traditional desktop use, this software enables innovative edge and cloud-based applications.

<!-- #### **Qing Wang**: Reproducibility of cerebellar involvement as quantified by consensus structural MRI biomarkers in advanced essential tremor
Essential Tremor (ET) is the most prevalent movement disorder with poorly understood etiology. We pre-registered our study, tested the hypothesis of cerebellar involvement through three types of neuroimaging biomarkers and further assessed the impacts of statistical models and cerebellar segmentation pipelines on the outcomes. Results showed a lack of replicability of literature findings. This study shows that current estimation of cerebellar involvement in ET is largely inflated and emphasizes the importance of sensitivity analysis in biological inferences. -->
