In the realm of MRI, particularly in neuroimaging, the reproducibility crisis has emerged as a pivotal challenge, casting significant doubts on the reliability of many scientific findings. This session aims to delve deep into the critical issues surrounding replication failures in brain imaging studies and explore strategic pathways towards enhancing the robustness and validity of research outcomes.
#### **Zhi-Yi Chen**: Population diversity flaw in the AI-empowered neuroimaging studies and generalization failure
Though the immense potentials and unprecedented increases in the AI-empowered neuroimaging-based studies, particularly in diagnostics, global population diversity in these computational models are highly underrepresented. Embracing AI techniques in the  neuroimaging studies should be greatly welcomed, but as a result, sampling inequalities from AI model training and testing biases from AI model deployments substantially limited their real-world practices and ensuing benefits.
#### **Stephanie Noble**: Mapping the Landscape of Effect Sizes in fMRI: Insights from Large Publicly Available Dataset
Understanding what range of effect sizes are “typical” for fMRI studies is essential for better study planning and interpretation of results, especially given recent concerns about reproducibility and statistical power in fMRI research. Here, we leverage large, publicly available datasets to benchmark expected effect sizes for “typical” studies and introduce a web app for exploring these effects. We emphasize the need to plan for small effect sizes and discuss paths forward, including our next steps developing an empirical power calculator web app.
#### **Martin Hebart**: The THINGS initiative: Improving the generalizability of research findings in vision and semantics across studies, methods, and domains
Visual and semantic processing has been studied using both hypothesis-driven and data-driven approaches. However, the generalizability of research findings always depends on the selection of stimulus materials, and with inconsistent use of materials, it has been challenging to directly relate research findings across studies, research methods (e.g., behaviour, fMRI, electrophysiology), and domains (e.g., humans, animal models, artificial intelligence). To overcome these challenges, we have introduced the THINGS initiative, which is a global initiative of researchers to collect and share datasets all based on the THINGS database of object concepts and images. In this talk, I will highlight the opportunities afforded by this initiative, introduce available datasets, and highlight research findings that have underscored the value of this approach.

#### **Mary Miedema**: Meeting contributors where they’re at: case studies from Physiopy in making code contribution accessible
In this talk, I will discuss a range of strategies that have helped new contributors to advance Physiopy's code base, including the organization of codesprints, participation in Google's Summer of Code, and the ongoing compilation of contribution standards and other community coding knowledge.  
#### **Qing Wang**: Reproducibility of cerebellar involvement as quantified by consensus structural MRI biomarkers in advanced essential tremor
Essential Tremor (ET) is the most prevalent movement disorder with poorly understood etiology. We pre-registered our study, tested the hypothesis of cerebellar involvement through three types of neuroimaging biomarkers and further assessed the impacts of statistical models and cerebellar segmentation pipelines on the outcomes. Results showed a lack of replicability of literature findings. This study shows that current estimation of cerebellar involvement in ET is largely inflated and emphasizes the importance of sensitivity analysis in biological inferences.

My colleagues and I developed two small tools to help alleviate these difficulties. We tried to make them low-dependency, well-documented, and user-friendly. 

<br>

### **Sustainable volunteering** (13:00 - 15:00 UTC)
We often commit our time to Open MRI projects with an altruistic streak: the work is voluntary and based on our self-motivation. However, people in open science projects have a day job with other and higher priorities, and because the incentive structure in their career domain doesn’t align with sustainability and collaboration, progress in open science projects is often slow. Here, we want to learn from open science experts as well as other fields of volunteering how to navigate these sometimes conflicting demands and stay happy, healthy and productive in the process.
#### **Chuan-Peng Hu**: Promoting Open Science in a Developing Country
